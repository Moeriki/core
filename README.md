Curveball
=========

Curveball is a framework for building web services in Node.js. It fullfills a
similar role to [Express][1] and it's heavily inspired by [Koa][2].

This web framework has the following goals:

* A minimal foundation.
* Completely written in and for [TypeScript][3].
* Modern Ecmascript features.
* Async/await-based middleware.
* Native support for HTTP/2, including easy access to HTTP/2 Push.
* Native support for modern HTTP features, such as [`103 Early Hints`][4].
